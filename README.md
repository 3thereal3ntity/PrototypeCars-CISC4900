## About

Our project is a collaborative effort by a group of four programmers who are passionate about creating a realistic driving simulator. Our aim is to develop a simulator that offers an immersive experience with a variety of cars, each meticulously crafted to have its own unique handling and feel.

In our simulator, every car will behave differently based on engine placement, drivetrain type and weight distribution. Through advanced algorithms and programming techniques, we're striving to simulate the intricacies of real-world driving dynamics. The way each car is set up will influence its behavior, allowing for a dynamic and engaging experience that evolves with your driving style, as well as showcases the pros and cons of each main drivetrain type and weight distribution.

We're dedicated to delivering a realistic and enjoyable driving simulation that caters to both casual players and enthusiasts alike as well as clearly showcases the differences in car behavior based on the setup the player goes with.

## Features

Our driving simulator will boast a range of features designed to enhance your gaming experience:

- **Car Selection Menu**: Explore a diverse selection of cars through an intuitive menu interface. Choose from various types of cars, each offering its own unique driving experience.

- **View Car Stats**: Dive deep into the specifications of each vehicle with our comprehensive car stats viewing feature. Get insights into performance metrics, handling characteristics, and more, enabling you to make informed decisions when selecting your ride.

- **Customizable Car Weight Distribution**: Tailor the weight distribution of your vehicle to suit your driving preferences, allowing for finer control and handling adjustments.

- **And More**: Stay tuned for additional features and updates as we continue to develop our driving simulator. We're committed to delivering an immersive and engaging experience for all players.


## Usage

Our driving simulator project serves as a robust foundation for developers looking to implement a realistic driving mechanic in their own games. Whether you're working on a small indie project or a large-scale AAA title, our simulator provides a solid framework that you can build upon to achieve lifelike driving dynamics.

By studying our codebase and understanding the algorithms and techniques employed, developers can gain valuable insights into simulating realistic vehicle behavior. From handling physics to car customization features, our project offers a wealth of resources that can be adapted and integrated into a wide range of driving games.

Utilize our project as a reference, leverage our code snippets, and tailor them to suit your specific requirements. With our driving simulator as your foundation, you'll be well-equipped to create captivating driving experiences that resonate with players.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and innovate with our project, and let your creativity drive you towards crafting the next generation of immersive driving games.
